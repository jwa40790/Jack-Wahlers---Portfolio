This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for projects while trying to work on my coding skills. The projects demonstrate my ability to work with real-world datasets, write efficient queries, and apply advanced SQL techniques.

<h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>

<h3>Warehouse and Retail Sales</h3>
&#128204; <b>Dataset:</b> <a href='https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/warehouse-and-retail-sales'>Data.gov</a>
<br>
&#128204; <b>Tools Used:</b> MySQL

In this <a href='https://github.com/jwa40790/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/WR_Sales.sql'>project</a>, I used a dataset containing a list of alcohol sales and movement data, which was updated monthly. Using MySQL I created queries that could be used in a business setting to analyze inventory, track sales trends, and optimize warehouse operations.

<b>Key Queries</b>
- Identified top-selling products based on total revenue
- Used window functions to calculate moving averages of sales
- Aggregated monthly sales per product category
