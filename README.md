<b>Warehouse and Retail Sales</b>

&#128204; <b>Dataset:</b> <a href='https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/warehouse-and-retail-sales'>Data.gov</a>
<br>
&#128204; <b>Tools Used:</b> MySQL

In this <a href='https://github.com/jwa40790/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/WR_Sales.sql'>project</a>, I used a dataset containing a list of alcohol sales and movement data, which was updated monthly. Using MySQL I created queries that could be used in a business setting to analyze inventory, track sales trends, and optimize warehouse operations.

<b>Key Queries</b>
- identified top-selling products based on total revenue
- used window functions to calculate moving averages of sales
- aggregated monthly sales per product category
