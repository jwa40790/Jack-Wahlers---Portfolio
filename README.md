# Jack Wahlers Portfolio
This repository contains examples of SQL and Python I've written for projects while trying to work on my coding skills. The projects demonstrate my ability to work with real-world datasets, write efficient queries, and apply advanced SQL techniques.

<h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>

<h3>Warehouse and Retail Sales</h3>
&#128204; <b>Dataset:</b> <a href='https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/warehouse-and-retail-sales'>Data.gov</a>
<br>
&#128204; <b>Tools Used:</b> MySQL
<br>
<br>

<p>In this <a href='https://github.com/jwa40790/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/WR_Sales.sql'>project</a>, I used a dataset containing a list of alcohol sales and movement data, which was updated monthly. Using MySQL, I created queries that could be used in a business setting to analyze inventory, track sales trends, and optimize warehouse operations.</p>

<b>Key Queries</b>
- Identified top-selling products based on total revenue
- Used window functions to calculate moving averages of sales
- Aggregated monthly sales per product category

<h3>Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate Capstone</h3>
&#128204; <b>Tools Used:</b> Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
<br>
<br>
<p>In this <a href='https://github.com/jwa40790/Jack-Wahlers---Portfolio/blob/main/Capstone.ipynb'>project</a>,  I analyzed a dataset containing employee information, such as years of employment, monthly hours, and satisfaction scores, to predict which employees would leave the fictional company, Salifort Motors.</p>

<p>After cleaning the dataset and visualizing trends with Seaborn, I built a logistic regression model that correctly predicted when employees would stay 96% of the time. However, the model struggled to predict departures, correctly identifying only 19% of employees who left. This could be due to the class imbalance in the data as the majority of employees stayed with the company.</p>
