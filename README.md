This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for projects while trying to work on my coding skills.

<h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>
<b>Warehouse and Retail Sales</b> - In this <a href='https://github.com/jwa40790/SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/WR_Sales.sql'>project</a>, I used a dataset found on <a href='https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/warehouse-and-retail-sales'>Data.gov</a> containing a list of alcohol sales and movement data that was updated monthly. Using MySQL I created queries that would be relevant in a business setting.
